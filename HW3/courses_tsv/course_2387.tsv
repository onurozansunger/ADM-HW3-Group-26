Contemporary Identities - MSc	University of Bristol	Faculty of Social Sciences and Law	['Full Time', 'Part Time']	The study of identity is a burgeoning area of sociological and cultural studies. Over a range of units, this programme provides an introduction to key themes in this field, with identity explored in both theoretical and substantive ways.On the one hand, there has been an exciting and innovative strand of work that explores and re-theorises the ideas of subjectivity and selfhood in the context of changes brought about by late modern and postmodern society. On the other, the question of identity has come under scrutiny within substantive areas of sociology, such as the sociology of race and ethnicity, the sociology of religion and the sociology of gender relations.

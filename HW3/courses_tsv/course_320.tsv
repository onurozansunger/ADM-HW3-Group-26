MSC IN HUMAN RIGHTS AND DATA SCIENCE	The American University of Paris	Graduate Programes	['Full Time']	We live in a changing world. As developments in Big Data, artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things transform the careers of the future, the world must develop concurrent principles for the ethical use of such technologies. In fields as varied as digital commerce, warfare and humanitarianism, comprehensive legal frameworks protect individuals’ rights to data privacy – often backed up by technical solutions. The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has established a new normal of data privacy regulation for companies and organizations across the world. The IAPP has estimated that as many as 75,000 data protection officers needed to be appointed globally in response to the GDPR. The Covid-19 pandemic has brought the need for data protection into even sharper relief.  	See Course	Please see the university website for further information on fees for this course.

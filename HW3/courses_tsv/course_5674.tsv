Master of Science (MS) in Counterterrorism	Capitol Technology University 	Masters Opportunities	[]	The Master of Science (M.S.) in Counterterrorism degree is a flexible online ten-course program that provides a comprehensive specialization in terrorism and counterterrorism studies in all their manifestations. Beginning with an introductory course on intelligence analytic methods and their application to terrorism and counterterrorism, the next courses focus on the components of terrorism and counterterrorism in the United States and internationally, as well as critical infrastructure protection and cybersecurity. The final two courses, “Tools and Techniques of Counterterrorism” and “Seminar in Terrorism and Counterterrorism” expose students to the application of significant methodologies and tools in the study of terrorism and counterterrorism, such as Analyst's Notebook, Social Network Analysis, Excel, Root Cause Analysis, Enterprise Security Risk Management (ESRM), Metrics of Programmatic Effectiveness, Forecasting Methodologies, Datamining, Protective Intelligence Platforms, Artificial Intelligence, and others. The program’s final course is a practicum project, with the students writing a thesis in which they apply one or more of the methodologies and software tools to analyze how to formulate a counterterrorism campaign plan to address a significant terrorism case. This will provide the students the opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge and expertise gained in the courses.

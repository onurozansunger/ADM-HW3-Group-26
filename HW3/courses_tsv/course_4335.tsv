How to build a spider after whole genome duplication	Durham University	Department of Biosciences	[]	Spiders are an extremely successful and diverse order of arthropods represented by over 50,000 described species, and exhibiting many evolutionary innovations including, multiocular vision, silk production, web-building and synthesis of venoms. Gene duplication plays a major role in animal evolution and diversification, and we have shown that there was a whole genome duplication (WGD) during the evolution of spiders and their relatives, like the independent WGDs in vertebrates.

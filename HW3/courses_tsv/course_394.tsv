MSc Renewable Energy & Environmental Finance	University College Dublin	UCD College of Business	['Full Time', 'Part Time']	The MSc in Sustainable Finance (formerly called the MSc in Renewable Energy & Environmental Finance) is designed to provide students with real-world insights into the application of finance in achieving sustainable outcomes for corporations, and the process of investing, financing, and building renewable energy projects. It is estimated that achieving the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030 will require investments of $5-7 trillion annually across both the public and private sector. The estimated $2.5 trillion investment gap every year in the developing world is a significant challenge but also an opportunity for policy makers, investors and businesses alike.

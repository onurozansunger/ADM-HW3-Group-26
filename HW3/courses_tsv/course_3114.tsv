Educational Leadership (MSc)	Queen’s University Belfast	School of Social Sciences, Education and Social Work	['Full Time', 'Part Time']	Leadership in schools is associated with fostering an environment where students can achieve their full potential and where educational staff are supported, motivated and can professionally develop. Effective school leaders are often described as having the capacity to transform and motivate others, they have vision, experience and expertise. This course takes the view however, that effective schools have leaders that can be found all-across a school and not necessarily confined only to those in senior positions. Key ideas explored in this course are leadership that is distributed, collaboration and the benefits of networks, transformational leadership and how effective leadership can change and improve schools.

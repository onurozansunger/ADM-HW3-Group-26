Master of Science in Ocean Engineering	Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University	Masters Programmes	['Part Time']	AOE’s ocean engineering graduate program focuses on hydronautics, naval engineering, and autonomous systems.“The most useful (and most stressful) part of getting my degree was taking the thesis option. I spent nearly 1 1/2 years working on the thesis, and the experience prepared me for writing proposals and reports more than anything I'd taken in school previously or done at work. For anyone trying to decide whether or not to do the thesis, I suggest going with the thesis. It provides more preparation for your career than I ever though possible, and even though it was hard, I'm better off for having done it.”Lauren Hanyok, Ocean Engineering Graduate, 2012Required courses M.S. in ocean engineering	See Course	Please see the university website for further information on fees for this course.

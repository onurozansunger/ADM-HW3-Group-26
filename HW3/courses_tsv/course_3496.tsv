Epidemiology - MSc	University of Bristol	Faculty of Health Sciences	['Full Time', 'Part Time']	Epidemiology is the study of disease and health outcomes in populations. It is about finding causes - the reasons why some people become ill, and the reasons why some populations are healthier than others - and what we can do to remove or control these causes. It is the science underpinning public health, clinical research and healthcare evaluation. The MSc in Epidemiology will enable you to engage with the complex population health challenges facing the global community in future decades, providing high-quality training in epidemiological methods that are applicable to low, middle and high income settings. The programme is suitable for students from both clinical and non-clinical backgrounds.	September	Please see the university website for further information on fees for this course.

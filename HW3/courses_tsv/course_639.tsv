Advanced Chemical Engineering with Bioprocessing - MSc/PGDip	University of Birmingham	School of Chemical Engineering	['Full Time', 'Part Time']	Our Advanced Chemical Engineering with Bioprocessing programme explores advanced chemical engineering topics with an emphasis on bioprocessing – using biological systems to produce useful products.Chemical engineering is dynamic and evolving, and today extends far beyond its roots in oil and gas processing. It provides many solutions to problems facing the biotechnological, pharmaceutical, healthcare, energy and food and drink sectors. Biological processes are increasingly important in modern chemical engineering, from production of biopharmaceuticals such as insulin, the industrial switch from chemical engineering.

Forest and Nature Conservation MSc	Wageningen University & Research	Environmental Sciences	['Full Time']	The master's Forest and Nature Conservation focuses on policy, sustainable management and conservation of forest and nature, i.e. understanding and predicting the effect of phenomena such as deforestation, biodiversity loss, ecotourism, timber production and animal reintroduction. Insights into all aspects of forest and nature conservation are required to address these issues. The study programme represents an integrated approach to natural resource management that can be applied at different scales, to diverse ecosystems and in varying political and social contexts. An outstanding research environment and three comprehensive specialisations contribute to making the programme challenging for undergraduates from both the natural and social sciences.

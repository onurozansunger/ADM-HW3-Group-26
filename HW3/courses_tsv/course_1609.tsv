Brand Communication (Specializing Master)	POLI.design, Società consortile a responsabilità limitata	Postgraduate Courses	['Full Time', 'Online']	The whole world of public relations is currently shot through with transformative change. The word “advertising,” still on the lips of many today, represents a misnomer and, in any event, refers to only one of many communication techniques in a much more complex and specialized milieu. Traditionally sought-after skill sets are being redesigned to meet the far-reaching changes in enterprise, in the market, and in brand-oriented consumption. To meet this demand, UNA – Aziende della Comunicazione Unite and POLI.design have launched the Brand Communication: Designing, Building, and Managing a Brand Specializing Master as a way to enhance the role of the communication consultant, thus establishing common ground between skills that belong to the field of communication and those that belong to the most innovative fields at the Politecnico di Milano. The Specializing Master aims to employ the proper tools to manage the ongoing changes and fill a need to coordinate strategic thinking for the brand, at whose heart lies brand equity.

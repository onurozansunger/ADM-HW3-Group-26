Anthropology of International Development and Humanitarian Assistance MSc	Brunel University London	Anthropology	['Full Time', 'Part Time']	Ask BrunelOver the last ten years, global aspirations to reduce the suffering of the ‘bottom billion’ have led to unprecedented attention on international development. International agencies, governments and NGOs are working more intensely than ever before to deliver appropriate policies and interventions.Anthropology has played a key role in the emergence of new perspectives on humanitarian assistance and the livelihoods of populations caught up in extreme circumstances such as famines, natural disasters and wars.On the one hand, this has led to a radical re-thinking of what has been happening, but on the other hand, it has led to anthropologists sometimes playing controversial roles in agendas associated with the ‘war on terror’.

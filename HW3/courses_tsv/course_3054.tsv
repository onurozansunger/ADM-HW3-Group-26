Economics (M.Sc.)	University of Hamburg	School of Business, Economics and Social Sciences	['Full Time']	"Today's economists face globally competitive and increasingly complex environments. Universität Hamburg's ""Master of Science in Economics"" (MSc) programme responds effectively to these developments. It provides thorough and rigorous training in modern economic theories and techniques. It attaches great importance to quantitative skills and emphasises state-of-the-art methods of empirical research. It encourages applied work and relates it to policy. The acquired tools and research skills prepare students for real-world economic situations and challenges. The programme is taught completely in English. It provides sound training in best practice methods of mainstream economics. Opportunities for optional in-depth studies in areas of personal interest initiate a gradual transition to independent research.

The regular two-year version of the programme is structured as follows: 1. Three research-oriented core courses in the first semester (Advanced Microeconomics, Advanced Macroeconomics, and Advanced Econometrics). 2.

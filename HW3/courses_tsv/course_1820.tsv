Chemical Engineering MSc	Rochester Institute of Technology USA	Masters Programs	[]	The chemical engineering master’s degree prepares you to develop new, high-tech materials for use across a range of critical industries, including semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, renewable energy systems, battery and alternative energies, and more.OverviewWhy Study RIT’s Chemical Engineering Master’s DegreeAdvanced Course Work with Capstone Project: Chemical engineering students receive training in latest theory, principles, and processes to design engineered systems culminating in an independent project.Hands-On Experience: Students may pursue research for credit with a faculty member, graduate internships, and cooperative education through paid full-time work in industry.Strong Career Paths: Students are hired at industry-leading companies, such as Bausch & Lomb, Boston Beer Company, Regeneron, DuPont, Eastman Kodak Company, Global Tungsten and Powders, Northrop Grumman, Global Foundries, The Hershey Company, and more.Chemical engineers apply the core scientific disciplines (chemistry, physics, biology, and mathematics) to transform raw materials or chemicals into more useful or valuable forms, invariably in processes that involve chemical change. In research and development, chemical engineers not only create new, more effective ways to manufacture chemicals, but also work collaboratively with chemists to pioneer the development of new high-tech materials for specialized applications. The development, commercialization, and optimization of the industrial-scale processes for manufacturing chemicals and advanced materials are feats of chemical engineering. Virtually every aspect of a modern industrial economy is critically dependent upon chemical engineering for manufacturing the vast array of bulk and specialty chemicals and high-tech materials needed to create a limitless array of value-added products.

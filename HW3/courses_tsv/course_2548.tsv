Cyber Security and Digital Forensics (Distance Learning)	University of Portsmouth	School of Computing	['Part Time']	Overview As the world grows increasingly technology-reliant, cyber security and digital forensics have become recognised as two incredibly important areas for organisations to manage.Cyber security differs significantly from cybercrime – with the latter being used to describe the illegal and/or harmful behaviours carried out online.While students of our MSc Cybercrime will strive to understand the driving forces behind online criminal activity, cyber security deals with the process of predicting, avoiding, and reacting to these acts. With this Master’s course, you’ll also learn key techniques to investigate digital crimes and security breaches, and help safeguard your organisation’s success.

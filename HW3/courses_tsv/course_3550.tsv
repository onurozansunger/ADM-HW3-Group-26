Evolutionary Behavioural Science MSc by Research	Middlesex University	Faculty of Science and Technology	['Full Time', 'Part Time']	Discover how evolutionary behavioural science develops testable hypotheses to establish what instances or kinds of behaviour are, and are not, adaptations.Why study the MSc Evolutionary Behavioural Science by Research at Middlesex University?Behaviour gives an organism a flexible, adaptive or even plastic ability to respond to a finite set of changeable variables that they are likely to encounter in their lives. The term behaviour captures an array of phenotypic responses to ecological variables. A good working hypothesis is that behaviour has evolved and has therefore been selected for. This does not mean that all instances of behaviour, or even all kinds of behaviour, are adaptations.

Environmental Modelling and Data Analysis - MSc	University of Bristol	Faculty of Science	['Full Time', 'Part Time']	Numerical models and satellite observation are fundamental to understanding environmental systems and change. The MSc in Environmental Modelling and Data Analysis will provide you with the skills to go on to a career in this exciting area. You will learn how models of environmental processes are developed and applied across a range of areas including climate change, flooding, biogeochemistry and glaciers. You will gain an appreciation of all aspects of environmental modelling ranging from the philosophy of model development, focussing on links to observations and uncertainty analysis, through to more practical aspects such as numerical approximation and algorithm development and testing.

Master Psychology, specialisation in Health and Social Psychology	Maastricht University	Faculty of Psychology and Neuroscience	['Full Time']	Why is it so hard for some people to limit their alcohol consumption? Why do some people lose their temper easily? Do you like finding answers to questions such as these? And can you see yourself helping people change their habits? Then you should consider specialising in Health and Social Psychology. The main focus of this specialisation is on understanding how people’s personalities, cognitions and social environment influence their health and social functioning. You'll analyse the underlying mechanisms of unhealthy or antisocial behaviour using recent theories and models from various psychological disciplines. And you'll use this knowledge to set up behaviour-change programmes. After completing your master’s, you can become a researcher in an academic or applied health setting, or work in communication planning, health promotion or policy-making.

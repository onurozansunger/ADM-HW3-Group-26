Master in Smart Mechanics	UBFC Graduate School EIPHI	Masters Opportunities	['Full Time']	Smart Mechanics MSc provides skills for the design of innovative solutions for applications such as vibroacoustic control (NVH), Structural Heath Monitoring (SHM), Shape Control, or Energy Harvesting for instance. Different strategies can be developed to add such new functionalities to structures as the design of geometrically architected technologies, the integration of smart materials with multiphysic behaviors, or the development of embedded sensors and actuators with their controllers. The program is inspired by these emerging technologies and opens ways to careers in industry consulting and research. The best students will have the opportunity to obtain a scholarship to prepare a doctoral thesis.	See Course	Please see the university website for further information on fees for this course.

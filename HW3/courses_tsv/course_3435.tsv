Environmental Geosciences	Czech University of Life Sciences Prague	Faculty of Environmental Sciences	['Full Time']	Environmental GeosciencesEnvironmental Geosciences graduates will gain the necessary theoretical and practical knowledge of Earth sciences, specifically in the field of geology, environmental geochemistry (e.g., environmental contamination), environmental hydrogeology and paleoecology (e.g., global climate development). During their studies, students will gain experience with modern analytical procedures and will attend practical courses and workshops. Environmental Geosciences are currently at the forefront of many scientific disciplines and have an important practical outcome as well. The understanding of pollutants’ behaviour in various environmental compartments, remediation of contaminated sites and evolution of ecosystems in the Earth’s history are just a few examples of the topics covered by the programme. The laboratories at the Faculty of Environmental Sciences are equipped with high-end instrumentation for advanced specialized methods used in environmental geochemistry, such as speciation and specialized isotope analyses. These techniques are currently fast emerging and crucial in the developing fields of Environmental Geochemistry and Biogeochemistry. The graduates can then be employed at many institutions dealing with nature protection and remediation (e.g., remediation companies, governmental agencies, regional authorities, etc.). Selected graduates can also continue their studies and research in a number of doctoral programmes.

Design Engineering with Sustainability MSc	University of Strathclyde	Department of Design, Manufacture & Engineering Management	['Full Time', 'Part Time']	This course addresses the issues associated with a rapidly changing market and the demands for better, cheaper and personalised products, developed within the shortest possible time.Ecological and ‘green’ constraints weigh significantly on engineering designers already and these pressures are likely to increase very significantly during the careers of today’s students. We consider the need for significant change in the design philosophy employed in industrialised manufacture and product development as well as responses to those pressures including legislation and standards, alternative processes and materials and design for resource economy at small and large scale.

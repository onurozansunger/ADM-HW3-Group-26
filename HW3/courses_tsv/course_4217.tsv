Health Economics and Health Policy Analysis - MSc	University of Bristol	Faculty of Health Sciences	['Full Time', 'Part Time']	Health economics and health policy analysis can enable decision makers to improve resource use and service delivery across health and care systems.

The programme will teach you key concepts in economics and policy by drawing on real-world examples from international contexts as well as the UK. This applied focus will ensure you are able to communicate and share economic and policy thinking and evidence with various audiences, including policymakers, academics, and the general public.

Applied Behaviour Analysis (MSc)	Queen’s University Belfast	School of Social Sciences, Education and Social Work	['Full Time', 'Part Time']	Behaviour analysis has been recognised as the basis for medically necessary intervention and educational provision for individuals on the autism spectrum and other clinical or non-clinical populations. With the growing prevalence of Autism Spectrum Disorders (now estimated to be 1:54) behaviour analysis has experienced a significant rise in popularity.There are over 57,000 certified behaviour analysts worldwide and this number is predicted to rise given that professional approval is seen as the key to delivering high quality services to individuals, families, in schools and in related settings. Furthermore, behaviour analysis is increasingly being applied to general education, special education, health and social care settings and organisational leadership settings.

Global Health and Mental Health MSc	St George’s, University of London	Graduate School	['Full Time', 'Part Time']	Although mental health is now increasingly more understood as a topic, addressing mental health has been a neglected and overlooked aspect of healthcare. In many societies around the globe, experiences related to the mind are not conceptualised as a health issue. Developing mental health infrastructure as part of global health systems is a contemporary encounter with important conceptual and ethical questions. At the same time, increased globalisation is bringing forth travelling cultures and traditional understandings about mental illness. Orthodox healthcare practitioners and policy-makers are responding to phenomena such as spirit possession, accusations of child witchcraft, curses, and forced exorcisms. Exploring culture and mental health questions fundamental aspects of our existence such as our identity, customs, and symbolisms against the backdrop of a human rights discourse and the need to address treatment gaps in global mental health.

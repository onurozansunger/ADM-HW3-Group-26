Earth Science & Engineering (MSc)	KAUST	Masters programmes	['Full Time']	We are faced with unprecedented challenges related to climate change, the energy transition, natural resources, pollution and degradation of the natural environment. Future earth scientists will play an important role in addressing and finding solutions to these pressing problems. In the Earth Science and Engineering (ErSE) Program we offer a range of courses and scientific projects that help students to acquire useful knowledge and skills to take on these challenges. Our M.Sc. and Ph.D. level courses cover many subjects in geophysics and geology as well as providing training in different data acquisition, data analysis and computational methods. Research within the program focuses on atmospheric and ocean processes, subsurface imaging, reservoir simulations, natural hazards and on the Red Sea rift, among many other topics. If you join us, you can select one of following four study tracks: Geophysics, Geology, Machine Learning in Geosciences, or Geophysical Fluids and Climate Systems. 	See Course	Please see the university website for further information on fees for this course.

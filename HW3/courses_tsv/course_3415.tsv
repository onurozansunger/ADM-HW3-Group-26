Environmental Analytical Chemistry - MSc	University of Bristol	Faculty of Science	['Full Time', 'Part Time']	Climate change, and air, water and soil pollution are critical societal problems that will affect most, if not all communities, companies, and countries across the globe over the next 50 years. This programme will train you in cutting-edge environmental analytical chemical techniques that are used to investigate such pollution and guide mitigation and remediation. More widely, this programme will train you in advanced laboratory analysis, statistical and modelling approaches to interrogating and synthesising datasets, and reporting and communicating data. A particular feature of this MSc is the synthesis of data with training in written, oral, and other forms of communication. There will be particular emphasis on the use of such data to develop policy and/or practical recommendations. In the research project, you will be working on current topics drawn from environmental research such as urban air pollution, water quality and sustainable agriculture.

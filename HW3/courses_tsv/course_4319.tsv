Historic Conservation - PgDip/PgCert/MSc	Oxford Brookes University	School of the Built Environment	['Full Time', 'Part Time']	How do we decide which buildings and environments need preserving? How do we better understand their physical fabric and the influences on their design and construction? How will they be conserved in future, and who will pay for this to happen? Study at Oxford Brookes to develop expertise in historic conservation and discover how we can preserve, learn from, and protect sites of historic importance. You’ll examine the ideas, laws and policies that define current conservation, including how these have changed - and evolve over time. You’ll explore how built heritage can be conserved, adapted and developed in a variety of ways. And you’ll learn fundamental concepts and conservation techniques, taught by leading experts in the field. 	September	Home (UK) full time - £9,300 (Masters); £8,300 (Diploma); £4,650 (Certificate) Home (UK) part time - £4,650 International full time - £16,300	PGDip,MSc,PGCert	1 year full time, 2 years part time (MSc), 9 months full time, 21 months part time (PgDip)	Oxford	United Kingdom	On Campus	https://www.findamasters.com/masters-degrees/course/historic-conservation-pgdip-pgcert-msc/?i188d7496c44991

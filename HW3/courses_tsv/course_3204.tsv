Electronic Information Engineering (M.Sc. / P.Grad.Dip.)	Trinity College Dublin	School of Engineering	['Full Time']	This is a one year full time or two year part-time postgraduate course designed to provide graduate engineers with specialist understanding of modern computational products and systems. There is no aspect of modern life that is not now altered by information processing engines. Examples include digital assistants (speech recognition and synthesis), automotive (remote sensing and electronic control systems), the economy (quantitative automated trading), entertainment (audiovisual streaming and cinema visual effects), health (medical imaging), science (computational biology/geography/chemistry/photography) and the digital humanities. The principles enabling the design of this new wave of products are embodied in the discipline of Information Engineering. This course allows graduates to specialise in fundamental theory and applications relating to the generation, distribution, analysis and use of information in engineering and science.

Energy Science - MSc/PgDip	Trinity College Dublin	School of Physics	['Full Time', 'Part Time']	This is a 1 year full time M.Sc. level course worth 90 ECTs, jointly taught between the Schools of Physics, Chemistry and Natural Science. The aim is to provide students with a science or engineering background, with a broad knowledge of the science and application of both conventional and sustainable energy technologies. The connection between physics, chemistry, earth science and economics determines how energy is utilised, the environmental consequences of its use, and in turn determines many government policies on climate change across the globe. A working understanding of each of these areas is necessary for students inspired to pursue a career in the renewable energy sector, or for those interested in communicating or managing the impact on the environment of the worlds energy use, such as climate change.

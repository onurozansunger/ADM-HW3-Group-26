Cognitive Behavioural Psychotherapy - MSc	Trinity College Dublin	School of Medicine	['On Campus']	Cognitive behavioural therapy is a collaborative, structured approach to helping individuals with psychological difficulties. Prospective candidates pursue a two-year part-time Master of Science course in Cognitive Behavioural Therapy. Emphasis will be on helping participants gain a high level of clinical competence in utilising this approach in hospital-based and community-based health care settings to a level that they will be able to apply for accreditation with appropriate accrediting bodies including the Proposed Registration Board for Psychological Therapists in Ireland. The course offers post-qualification training in the theory and practice of cognitive psychotherapy, as applied in a variety of mental health settings. Competence is developed through a combination of clinical supervision, lectures, workshops and written assignments. Assessment is based on the submission of case studies and theoretical reviews, oral presentations and standardised rating of therapy sessions. Students will complete a research project that is submitted as a dissertation in the Hilary term of the second year.

Economics & Finance - MSc	Cardiff Metropolitan University	Cardiff School of Management	['Full Time', 'Part Time']	In 2008 cataclysmic events shattered the world of Finance and caused shockwaves through the rest of the global economy. Some realised that change would be needed but none forecast that less than a decade on the sector would be so radically and irrevocably changed.The new MSc in Economics and Finance has been designed to develop postgraduate students who are equipped academically to succeed in an increasingly complicated and challenging global workplace. When you graduate, you will leave as a professional economist, who is equipped for an academic career, but who crucially is also ready to use economic thinking in the world outside academia. Well qualified economists are in demand in government, industry and, obviously commerce. 	September, January	As a postgraduate, research or part-time student, the tuition fees you are charged will depend on the course you choose to study.

However, hydrologists are increasingly focusing on the problems of pollutant transport in surface water, soils and groundwaters, and wider issues such as the effects of land use and climate change.Hydrology is strongly multidisciplinary, and this course includes a basic treatment of relevant physical and life sciences, mathematical sciences, and systems analysis.

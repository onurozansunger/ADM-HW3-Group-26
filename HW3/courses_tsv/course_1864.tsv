Child Protection Data Futures (Online Learning)	University of Edinburgh	Edinburgh Futures Institute	['Full Time', 'Part Time']	A new, interdisciplinary degree with the Edinburgh Futures InstituteThe MSc programme in Child Protection Data Futures aims to build data skills and connect disciplines for safer futures for all children. The current child protection system is fragmented and disjointed, with multiple data sets, sources, standards and capabilities. This means that it is difficult to join up data, obscuring the scale of complexity and challenges within the child protection system. Without high-quality data that can guide policy, funding and interventions, children continue to be exploited and abused, and perpetrators of abuse have impunity.

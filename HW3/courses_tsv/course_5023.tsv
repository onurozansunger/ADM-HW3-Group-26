Landscape Planning	Czech University of Life Sciences Prague	Faculty of Environmental Sciences	['Full Time']	Landscape PlanningThe Landscape Planning programme aims to sufficiently prepare graduates to be competitive on the international job market. The field of study is therefore strongly oriented toward acquisition of practical skills, wherein the professional staff of the faculty, including foreign scientific researchers, will share their current knowledge in the field of landscape planning, landscape ecology and landscape architecture with you. Students learn by working on real projects and become skilled in applied sustainable land use planning and resource management. We often focus this work on the dynamic and varied landscape of the Czech Republic, however sustainable approaches to landscape planning can be applied elsewhere. Landscape Planning is an accredited master´s degree programme required for practice of landscape engineering and design in the Czech Republic, the EU and applicable to international locations as well. The two-year study programme consists of required courses and research-based field studies. Course work includes: landscape ecology, landscape architecture, spatial planning, land management, landscape history, ArcGIS, aquatic ecosystems, soils and erosion control, and land reclamation.

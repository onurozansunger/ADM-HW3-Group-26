M.Sc. Computational Mathematics (English-taught)	University of Passau	Faculty of Computer Science and Mathematics	['Full Time']	In addition to being a science in its own right, mathematics plays a fundamental role in the quantitative areas of practically all other academic disciplines, particularly in the natural sciences, engineering, business administration, economics, medicine and psychology. Mathematical results permeate nearly all facets of life and are a necessary prerequisite for the vast majority of modern technologies – and as our IT systems become increasingly powerful, we are able to mathematically handle enormous amounts of data and solve ever more complex problems.

Civil Engineering	Vrije Universiteit Brussel	Faculty of Engineering	['Full Time']	About the programmeIf you want to shape a sustainable world, in planning, designing or constructing the built environment, and change the lives of millions of people for the better, our master in Civil Engineering at VUB is a great start! We offer a broad scientific basis in building material technology, modelling, design and construction of loadbearing structures, geotechnics and project construction management, and incorporate the latest evolutions in emerging fields like digitalisation and sustainability. Our key objective? To give you an in-depth understanding of the main aspects of analysis and design of all kinds of structures and a solid knowledge of material technology. Several systems are considered: conventionally reinforced or pre-stressed concrete structures, steel structures, as well as structures composed of novel materials like fibre-reinforced composites. An important issue is the optimisation of structures and the material selection, with due consideration of their environmental impact, sustainability and life-cycle cost. Our education is based on cutting-edge research that focuses on the design and analysis of innovative lightweight structures, computational modelling methods, structural health monitoring and environmental geotechnology.

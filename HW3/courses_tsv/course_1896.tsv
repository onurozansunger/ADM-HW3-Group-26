Civil Engineering - Master of Science (MS)	University of Colorado Boulder	College of Engineering	['Full Time']	The department's objective is to produce engineers capable of identifying, preventing and solving building, construction and environmental problems. In addition to the well-established graduate programs in environmental, water resource and geotechnical engineering, students in the department may also choose to study in the emerging field of geoenvironmental engineering. Campus facilities, including a National Science Foundation-funded earthquake simulator, permit a case-study approach, which exposes students to real-world problems and allows experimentation, testing and analysis.Areas of study within the Civil Engineering Department are:	See Course	Please see the university website for further information on fees for this course.

Investigation of brain anatomy across closely related bumblebee species, native to North-East England	Durham University	Department of Biosciences	[]	Investigation of brain anatomy across closely related bumblebee species native to North-East EnglandBumblebees are agriculturally important pollinators, but are currently declining in abundance in the UK and around the world, in part due to climate change (Soroye et al. 2020). Understanding these declines requires research on the biology and physiology of these species. Bumblebees are thought to be generalists, pollinating a variety of flower species. However, our preliminary observations conducted in Durham in summers 2020-22 indicate that different bumblebee species prefer different plants (see also Sikora et al. 2020). In addition, it has been reported that workers and drones of the same species also have different flower preferences. Bumblebees have been a preferred insect model for neuroethology and sensory neuroscience, however, most work has focused on Bombus terrestris in Europe (e.g. Li et al. 2017; Mertes et al. 2021) and Bombus impatiens in North America (e.g. Mares et al. 2005), with other species receiving little attention. In addition, most studies, including our own (e.g. Riabinina et al. 2014, Langridge et al. 2021), have focused on the bees’ behaviours alone, leaving the neuronal and genetic basis of their behaviours poorly understood. Thus, the neuronal basis of bees’ diverse flower preferences is currently unknown. This project will investigate and compare brain anatomy of 8 species of bumblebees, native to North-East England. We will specifically focus of antennal and optic lobes – olfactory and visual processing centres of an insect brain. We hypothesize that the brain anatomy reflects species- and sex-specific behavioural preferences of the bees.

Development Policy and Politics - MSc	University of Birmingham	School of Government	['Full Time', 'Part Time']	Our MSc in Development Policy and Politics makes a direct link between academic and practical policy approaches, focussing on the relationship between politics and development.It is now clearer than ever before that the greatest development challenges of our time – poverty, conflict, famine, poor governance etc. – are driven primarily by political, not technical, factors. The aim of this programme is to provide theoretical and empirical training to enable you to understand the role that politics plays in both facilitating and undermining development, in both the North and the South.

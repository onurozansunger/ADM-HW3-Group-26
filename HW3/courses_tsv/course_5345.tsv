Marine and Lacustrine Science and Management (Oceans & Lakes)	Vrije Universiteit Brussel	Faculty of Science and Bio-engineering Sciences	['Full Time']	There’s plenty of opportunity for practical experience too, thanks to laboratory and field training sessions, individual and group assignments, report presentations and discussion seminars, visits to marine research centres, excursions and internship... Not to mention your individual master’s thesis, which may be either field or laboratory based and includes governance or policy analyses. You benefit from the contacts and expertise of not one, but three high-quality Belgian universities: VUB, Ghent University and the University of Antwerp. The biology departments and research groups of all three are involved in developing and maintaining innovative and internationally recognised research programmes, along with a variety of international research networks. Our programme covers management and policy, as well as commercial aspects of aquatic ecosystems and law. With the expertise and experience gained in this master's programme, you'll have the knowledge and capacities to contribute to the most up-to-date forms of education, pure and applied research and policy-supporting assignments. 	September	The tuition fee for 2024-2025 will be: EU/EEA students: 1092 €/year Non EU/EEA students 1092 €/year	MSc	2 years	Brussels	Belgium	On Campus	https://www.findamasters.com/masters-degrees/course/marine-and-lacustrine-science-and-management-oceans-and-lakes/?i385d6809c25964

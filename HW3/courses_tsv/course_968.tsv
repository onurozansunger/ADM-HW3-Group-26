Aerospace Medicine MSc, PGDip	King’s College London	Faculty of Life Sciences & Medicine	['Full Time']	The Aerospace Medicine programme aims to provide specialist training for medical graduates in the discipline from its research orientated basic science to its operational and clinical application. The course is therefore appropriate for Flight Medical Officers (Flight Surgeons), specialists in aviation and space medicine and for clinicians from other disciplines with a role to fulfil in aerospace medicine. It is not the aim of the course to train individuals in clinical medicine but rather to use the knowledge and experience students already have from their medical practice to allow them to understand its specialist application in aviation and space medicine. 	September	Please see the university website for further information on fees for this course.

In this programme you will learn how to design and implement intelligent systems.The core topics in the Master's programme Artificial Intelligence are: autonomous perceptive systems, cognitive robotics and multi-agent systems.Autonomous SystemsA robot taking samples and collecting information on the moon is an example of an autonomous system. It operates and carries out missions independently. Regardless of its surroundings, it responds with a certain intelligence.

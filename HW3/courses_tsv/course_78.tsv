Digital Economy MSc	King’s College London	Faculty of Arts & Humanities	['Full Time', 'Part Time']	This programme focuses on digital where digital implies digital products, process, services, business models, monetization and even orchestration. We will study what happens to the digital in each of these spheres and why the ‘digital’ artefact is changing how we work, transact, collaborate and control labour, institutions, and markets around the world. It will be a journey of tracing the digital artefact as it evolves and shifts, followed by an understanding of the societal implications of the change wrought by the growth of digital phenomenon. This programme offers students a unique and compelling mix of theory and practical knowledge of the digital economy.

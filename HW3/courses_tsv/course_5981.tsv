Masters in Monetary and Financial Economics	University of Lisbon	ISEG - Lisbon School of Economics and Management	['Part Time', 'Online']	OVERVIEWThe Master's in Monetary and Financial Economics is an international-level programme that follows the best European practices in the area. As such, the selection criteria of applicants are demanding and this exigency level is kept along the course. Thus, the MEMF is not compatible with a weak background and with a low-effort profile, as we expect students to be prepared to spend a minimum of 3200 effort hours in 2 years.The effort required from MEMF students is strongly valued in the labour market. Employers especially recognise to MEMF graduates a strong background in econometrics and quantitative methods, competence in macroeconomics and monetary economics, and a large capacity to face new challenges.

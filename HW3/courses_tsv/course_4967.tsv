International Wealth Management - MS	ESCP Business School (London Campus)	Business and Management Department- London	['On Campus']	In 1995, ESCP Business School created one of the first Specialised Masters® in Wealth Management which, due to its success, was redesigned for the executive market in 2005.Faced with the development of a multi-professional environment, growing internationalisation, and increasingly complex personal asset issues regarding both key players and wealth management activities in this field, ESCP Business School has decided to develop these programmes into a truly international curriculum; the only one of its kind.The programme is entirely oriented towards international markets. It is taught over 6 months on our Paris Campus and our London Campus and includes a one-week seminar in Geneva.

Digital Health - MSc	University of Bristol	Faculty of Engineering	['Full Time']	The future of health is digital. We urgently need new technologies for understanding, preventing, diagnosing, and managing illnesses that affect millions of people, such as diabetes, depression and dementia. The digital health industry is expected to grow six times in size over the next five years, at a rate of nearly 30% a year. Driven by the risk of future pandemics and the health needs of ageing populations in countries worldwide, this growth is expected to continue for decades to come.The demand for graduates in this area is therefore unprecedented. If you have a first degree in a health science, computer science, life science, mathematics or engineering subject, we want to help you develop as a leader in this area.

Data Analytics for Government - MSc/PgDip/PgCert (online)	University of Glasgow	College of Science and Engineering	['Part Time']	While the amount of data being produced is proliferating at a staggering rate, the skills to extract information and the value we receive from it are both relatively scarce. Analytics and data-driven decisioning is playing an increasingly important role in the economy, society and public administration. Designed together with the Office for National Statistics, our MSc in Online Data Analytics for Government is based on our successful online MSc programme in Data Analytics and will provide you with vital skills required to develop your modelling and data handling expertise. You will gain a firm grounding in the principles of learning from data sets, whilst at the same time getting hands-on experience handling, analysing and visualising data, helping your organisation to maximise the insights and value extracted from its data.

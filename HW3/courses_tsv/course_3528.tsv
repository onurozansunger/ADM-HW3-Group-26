European Masters Program Language & Communication Technologies	Saarland University, Germany	Erasmus Mundus Master Program	['Full Time']	Program BriefThe LCT program is an international distributed Master program. It is designed to meet the demands of industry and research in the rapidly growing field of Language Technology. Research and innovation in Language Technology is vital for many of the smart applications that are pervasive in modern daily life, such as virtual assistants, automatic translation services, search engines, voice-driven technology, social media analytics etc. Language Technology (also known as Computational Linguistics or Natural Language Processing (NLP)) is an interdisciplinary field at the intersection of Linguistics, Computer Science and Mathematics (logic, probability theory, formal language theory, statistics). Hence, students in this program choose appropriate combinations of modules in Language Technology, Computational and Theoretical Linguistics, and Computer Science. Moreover, the students are able to acquire practice-oriented knowledge through our strong and continuous links with industry through internships, joint industry-academia supervisions, and the like.

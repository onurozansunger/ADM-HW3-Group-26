Clinical Health Psychology (MSc)	Queen’s University Belfast	School of Psychology	['Full Time', 'Part Time']	Clinical health psychology (sometimes referred to as behavioural medicine, medical psychology or psychosomatic medicine) is an applied discipline that focuses on people with a health condition that could be prevented, treated or rehabilitated through the use of psychological techniques or procedures. The primary interest is on problems that present as physical complaints rather than emotional or mental health issues. Nevertheless, clinical health psychology is concerned with the emotional problems that may arise as a result of a physical health complaint. The topics covered in the MSc include: research methods, health behaviour change, psycho-oncology and adjustment to long term physical illness.

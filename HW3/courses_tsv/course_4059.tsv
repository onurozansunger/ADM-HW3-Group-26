Global Health	Vrije Universiteit Brussel	Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy	['Full Time']	Organising universitiesThe master is a collaboration between Ghent University, Catholic University of Leuven, Hasselt University, Vrije Universiteit Brussel and Antwerp University. With the master of Science in Global Health, we want to focus on health issues and determinants that are regarded as global challenges for the 21st century: chronic conditions, mental health and ageing, but also the effects of pollution, climate change and migration on health. The complexity of these challenges requires a transnational, interdisciplinary approach (including social sciences, ecological sciences, health sciences, legal sciences and economics) with input from a variety of actors (including governments, international organizations, civil society and professional associations). Global health is, therefore, to a large extent multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary and focused on cooperation.

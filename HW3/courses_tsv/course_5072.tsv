Learning in Interaction	University of Groningen	Behavioural and Social Sciences	['Full Time']	How do students learn in schools? What role do individual differences play in learning? How can you improve learning environments to optimally help students learn and develop?Common to all processes referred to in the questions above, is that they take place while and because we interact. Interaction is the motor of learning and development, and therefore key to improving education.While we all can recognize these interactions, in this master’s track you will learn to take a scientific, evidence-based approach to better examine these day-to-day interactions. This master zooms in on the complex processes through which we learn academic subjects, develop cognitive and meta-cognitive skills, and acquire social competencies.

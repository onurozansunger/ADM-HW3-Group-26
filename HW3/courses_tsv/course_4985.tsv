Investigating cell division and contractility in animal cells	Durham University	Department of Biosciences	['Full Time']	Investigating cell division and contractility in animal cellsCytokinesis, the division of one cell into two, is a cellular process critical to life. It is also an extreme example of dynamic and robust cellular shape change. Division failure and the resulting chromosome damage is a driver of oncogenesis, while also being targeted by many chemotherapeutics. Similarities in the structural and molecular organization of the division apparatus give the impression that there is a standard mechanism underlying division, including formation and constriction of an actomyosin contractile ring, which does not vary between cells of different identities and fates. However, recent studies indicate the situation is more complex, with some proteins that have previously been thought of as essential not being required in all cases. 	October, January	Self-funded students only	MSc,MRes	Full Time - 1 year, Part Time - 2 years	Durham	United Kingdom	Part Time	https://www.findamasters.com/masters-degrees/course/investigating-cell-division-and-contractility-in-animal-cells/?i67d5142c70863

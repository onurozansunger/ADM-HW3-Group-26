Computational Mathematics - MSc/PGDip	Heriot-Watt University	School of Mathematical and Computer Sciences	['Full Time', 'Part Time']	Accurate and efficient scientific computations lie at the heart of most cross-discipline collaborations. It is vital that such computations are performed in a stable, efficient manner and that the numerics converge to the true solutions of the dynamics of the physics, chemistry or biology in the problem.The programme closely follows the structure of our MSc in Applied Mathematical Sciences and is designed to equip students with the skill to perform efficient and accurate computer simulations in a wide variety of applied mathematics, physics, chemical and industry related problems.

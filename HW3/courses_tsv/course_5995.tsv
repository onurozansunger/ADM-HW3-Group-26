Masters's in Digital Politics and Governance	European School of Political and Social Sciences (ESPOL)	Masters Programs	['Full Time']	Digitalisation is a critical issue in today’s global and European politics. The fast spread of the internet to 63% of global population today and the increased use of digital tools for politics and policy-making bring about new opportunities and challenges. It was hoped that the internet and digital tools would reduce barriers leading to more collective, democratic and borderless collaboration inducing positive social and political change. More recently, the internet is seen to more likely reinforce existing barriers and even as a rising threat to individuals, society, democratic processes and governments. Thus, this master brings together students from different backgrounds to study various political, legal and social problems of today’s digitalisation processes and explore solutions for these new challenges.

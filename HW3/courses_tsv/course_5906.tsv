Master of Science in Wine & Spirits Management	Kedge Business School	International Programme	['Full Time']	"""Wine and spirits constitute an ever-changing ecosystem, a fragmented industry, a complex yet fascinating one. To gain an understanding of the product and the marketplace it’s necessary to have solid technical bases, but also to be able to assess the financial, economic, marketing and environmental issues, the trends, the opportunities and the constraints. To meet tomorrow’s challenges, students need to have been given the keys, to be guided, and then to develop a global vision."

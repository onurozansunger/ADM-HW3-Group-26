Biosystems Engineering MSc	Wageningen University & Research	Life Sciences	['Full Time']	The master's programme Biosystems Engineering focuses on the development of technology for the production, processing and storage of food and agricultural non-food, management of the rural area, renewable resources and agro-industrial production chains. In all cases it concerns innovation and sustainable technology. The interaction between technology, plants, animals, the environment and society plays a central role. Developments in society at large often involve the development of new technology. The adoption of new technology and its integration within existing processes therefore requires special attention. This is why the programme also offers a course in technology assessment.	September	Please see the university website for further information on fees for this course.

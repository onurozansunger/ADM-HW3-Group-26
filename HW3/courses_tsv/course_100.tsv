Energy and Environmental Sciences MSc	University of Groningen	Science and Engineering	['Full Time']	What are the causes of the various large scale global environmental issues like climate change? Can we identify options to solve these issues? Are options different in different countries?The global challenges with respect to environment and sustainability are huge and can only be addressed in an interdisciplinary approach. Since it is impossible to address all these issues equally in a Master degree program, specialization is essential. The Energy and Environmental Sciences (EES) programme specializes in energy and is treating it from a natural science perspective. However, it trains the students that the natural sciences/technical approach to and solution of problems is only a part of the story and collaboration with other scientific disciplines is vital.

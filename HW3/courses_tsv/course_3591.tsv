Exploration Geophysics - MSc	University of Leeds	School of Earth & Environment	['Full Time']	Earth’s resources are essential for our energy future – resources like water, minerals, hydrocarbon reserves or geothermal heat, as well as natural ‘geoassets’ in which CO2 or hydrogen could be stored. Exploration geophysicists play a critical role in sourcing natural resources — and understand the full resource potential of the subsurface.That’s why the demand will always be high in this area, with organisations worldwide seeking more sustainable solutions that exploration geophysicists could provide.Our Exploration Geophysics MSc degree will train you in utilising physical techniques and a range of disciplines to study the Earth’s interior, including seismic, gravity, magnetic and geo-electrical methods, applied throughout marine and onshore settings.

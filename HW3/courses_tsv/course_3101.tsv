Education (Inclusive Education) - MSc	University of Bristol	Faculty of Social Sciences and Law	['Full Time', 'Part Time']	This pathway focuses on inclusive education. It explores and critiques barriers in society that prevent the inclusion and participation of disabled people (and those with labels of 'special' educational needs) as individuals with rights to citizenship. It rejects charity and individual deficit model interpretations that have - and continue to - place disabled people as in need of charity, cure, treatment and care. The programme draws upon the lived experiences of disabled people, their self-organisation, user-led campaigns for justice, and equality in education.

Applied Mathematics MSc	University of Groningen	Science and Engineering	['Full Time']	Why does one car have more air resistance than another? How can the frequency of the electric power smart grid be kept constant under external disturbances?Applied Mathematics is concerned with the development and application of mathematical tools for the analysis and design of dynamical systems that appear in modern technology. Mathematical modelling of the problems appearing there plays a basic role, followed by (numerical) analysis, (computer) simulation, and design of controllers to make the systems behave according to the desired specifications. Interaction with other disciplines and with specialists in the fields of application is essential.

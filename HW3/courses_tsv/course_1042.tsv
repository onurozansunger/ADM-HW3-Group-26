Animate Materials MSc by Research	Durham University	Department of Chemistry	['Full Time']	About the CourseAnimate materials are a new generation of smart materials that offer huge potential. These new MSc by research projects at Durham University offer graduate students the opportunity to be involved in world leading research into the development of these novel synthetic materials. Research ProfileAnimate materials have the potential to transform the world. They could allow us to create materials that use carbon dioxide to self-repair, clothing that can detect illness and buildings that form part of the ecosystem. Although no truly animate materials have yet been created, these are possible and research within the BSI is at the forefront of this field.	October	For most projects, basic research costs are met by the supervisor. The student will be liable for costs associated with optional conference attendance and for additional research costs for some projects (to be discussed with potential supervisors).  Please see the university website for further information on fees for this course.

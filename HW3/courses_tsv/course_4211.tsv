Health Economics (MSc)	Erasmus School of Economics	Masters Programmes	['Full Time']	Health care is a major sector of a modern economy, accounting for 10-18% of GDP in high-income countries. Advances in medical technology generate substantial improvements in population health but also create major economic and social challenges. Health care costs are rising rapidly. Population ageing both increases the need for health care and reduces the fraction of people working to pay for it. Health inequalities remain stubbornly high and further reduce productivity. Low-income countries have the greatest need for health care but are least able to pay for it. If you are motivated to contribute solutions to these challenges, then the Health Economics programme at Erasmus will equip you with the analytical and quantitative skills techniques you need.

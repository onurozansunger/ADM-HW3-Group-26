Environmental Modelling	Czech University of Life Sciences Prague	Faculty of Environmental Sciences	['Full Time']	Environmental ModellingModelling of environmental processes is a key part of daily practice in many public and private institutes. Indeed, assessment of flood risk, climate change impacts on water resources, efficient design of adaptation measures or contaminant transport, to name just a few, all require modelling. This is why environmental modellers are increasingly sought by employers. Environmental modelling master programme therefore prepares the graduates to combine knowledge of applied mathematics, statistics and informatics with understanding of processes related to atmosphere, soil, surface and subsurface water, groundwater and contaminant transport. 	October	20 000 CZK (approx. 800 EUR/year)	MSc	2 years	Prague	Czechia	On Campus	https://www.findamasters.com/masters-degrees/course/environmental-modelling/?i2581d8269c58985

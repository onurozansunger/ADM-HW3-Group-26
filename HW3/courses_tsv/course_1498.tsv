Biological Sciences (MSc)	Massey University	Sciences	['On Campus']	When you study Massey’s Master of Science with a major in biological sciences you don’t have to focus on one particular type of science, but will gain expertise across a range of your interests.If you are interested in subjects like microbiology, genetics and biochemistry, but don’t have all the prerequisites you need to specialise, or you want to open the door to a broader range of careers, a major in biological sciences gives you a broad-based degree that keeps your options open.Within the degree you can focus on one particular area of science, or keep your study broad - the choice is yours!

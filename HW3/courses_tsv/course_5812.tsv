Master of Science in Disability Studies	Atlantic Technological University	Online, Flexible and Professional Development	['Part Time']	Disability studies allow us to understand disability in a different way; as a positive social and political identity, rather than a health issue or something to be 'fixed' or arouse sympathy. The study of 'disability' is inextricably linked to the concept of equality. This programme may be of interest to disabled people in Ireland, or people currently working in the disability, community, health and social care sectors. People working for, or living with, disabled people may also be interested in the programme.Exit routes available atPostgraduate Diploma in Science (two years)Postgraduate Certificate (one year)﻿Location: ATU St	See Course	Please see the university website for further information on fees for this course.

Environmental Microbiology and Biotechnology (by Research) - MSc	Bangor University	College of Environmental Sciences and Engineering	['Full Time']	The MSc by Research in Environmental Microbiology and Biotechnology is a one-year full-time programme that differs from a taught Masters programme by placing more emphasis on research, and by being examined much more like a PhD, by viva voce (oral) examination, rather than by grading of coursework and dissertation. This degree will equip you with confidence and competence in the latest research skills (including generic skills such as literature searching, legal and ethical aspects, project planning, grant proposal writing, and statistical manipulation of data) and allow you to apply for further research training (PhD) programmes, or to directly apply for research positions in universities or research institutes.

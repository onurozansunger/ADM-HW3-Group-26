Marine Engineering with Specialisation in Autonomous Marine Vehicles MSc/PgDip	University of Strathclyde	Department of Naval Architecture, Ocean and Marine Engineering (NAOME)	['Full Time']	Industry 4.0 (Fourth Industrial Revolution) is the confluence of cyber-physical systems that are reshaping most sectors including the maritime sector. Autonomous technology is poised to transform the sector. Crewless vessels are now under development. It's already possible to explore the most extreme oceanic environments using autonomous and robotic systems. It's time for the maritime industry to understand how autonomous systems will shape the sector and how best to exploit them.This new programme aims to address an identified market need for a postgraduate qualification that is relevant to the maritime industry and which develops skills and knowledge in autonomy and IT technologies used in the sector.

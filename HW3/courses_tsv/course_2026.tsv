Our programme has an exceptionally strong reputation for the standard of training we offer, but to date this has been limited to the underpinning knowledge component of the British Psychological Society (BPS) Qualification in Clinical Neuropsychology (QiCN). The new combined programme adds the clinical practice component to our existing BPS accredited programme.	September	Please see the university website for further information on fees for this course.

Energy Resources & Petroleum Engineering (MSc)	KAUST	Masters programmes	['Full Time']	The Energy Resources and Petroleum Engineering (ERPE) Program, for both M.Sc. and Ph.D. students, focuses on modern reservoir description, engineering, and manage- ment. Students in this program receive advanced knowledge and training in geology, geophysical characterization, thermodynamics, geomechanics, fluid flow, and reservoir engineering. Our students participate in scientific research activities that may include mathematical analyses, computational modeling, experimental research, and field studies. Ph.D. candidates focus on original research-driven to advance the boundaries of knowledge, including challenging topics in energy and environment, such as enhanced oil recovery (EOR), geothermal, and carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS).

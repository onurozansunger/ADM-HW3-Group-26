Education (Open Pathway) - MSc	University of Bristol	Faculty of Social Sciences and Law	['Full Time', 'Part Time']	The MSc Education (Open Pathway) allows you to design your own programme of study based on your areas of interest, rather than tying you in to one subject area. You, therefore, have the opportunity to select units from across the different specialist pathways as well as from our wider bank of optional units (subject to availability and timetabling constraints). For example, if your interests span both educational policy and the use of technology in education, you might combine units from the Leadership and Policy Pathway with units from the Learning, Technology and Society Pathway.

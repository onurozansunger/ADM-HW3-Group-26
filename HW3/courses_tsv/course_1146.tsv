Applied Mathematical Sciences with Mathematical Biology, Ecology and Medicine - MSc	Heriot-Watt University	School of Mathematical and Computer Sciences	['Full Time', 'Part Time']	Since the 1990s Heriot-Watt University has had an internationally renowned research group in Mathematical Biology, Ecology and Medicine. This group includes Jonathan Sherratt, Andy White and Kevin Painter; all of whom are leading researchers in mathematical biology with strong international reputations. Building on the strength of this research group we are excited to be launching a brand new MSc Programme in Mathematical Biology Ecology and Medicine. The programme includes high level and high quality courses that will provide a comprehensive training in mathematical modelling of problems in the life sciences, in mathematical techniques to study these models, and in the use of data to both inform and test the models.

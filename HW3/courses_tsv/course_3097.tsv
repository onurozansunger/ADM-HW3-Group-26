Education (Learning, Technology and Society) - MSc	University of Bristol	Faculty of Social Sciences and Law	['Full Time', 'Part Time']	Our increasingly digital society creates a wide range of challenges and opportunities for educators and those who participate in and support learning around the world. Digital technologies (such as digital games, mobile devices, digital learning platforms, artificial intelligence, robots, social media, big data, and virtual or tangible technologies) are increasingly becoming embedded in our societies and being used in both educational settings and our everyday lives and learning. The Learning, Technology and Society pathway is designed for those who wish to take a critical perspective on the use of technology in diverse educational settings. Throughout this pathway we explore sociotechnical changes: how education and digital technologies are intertwined.

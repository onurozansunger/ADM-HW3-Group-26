Genetics and Molecular Biosciences - MSc	University of Helsinki	International Masters Degree Programmes	['Full Time']	Goal of the pro­grammeHow do genes regulate the development and functioning of cells, tissues and organisms? How do molecules, cells and tissues function and communicate with each other, and how are their functions studied? These are the key issues for understanding molecular and cellular mechanisms, whose disruption can contribute to the onset and progression of various diseases. Researchers in the fields of genetics, genomics, cellular and developmental biology, biochemistry, structural biology, and biosciences of health are searching for the answers to these questions.Upon completing the Master’s Programme in Genetics and Molecular Biosciences:	September	Tuition fee per year (non-EU/EEA students): 15000 €	MSc	2 years	Helsinki	Finland	On Campus	https://www.findamasters.com/masters-degrees/course/genetics-and-molecular-biosciences-msc/?i312d6223c45187

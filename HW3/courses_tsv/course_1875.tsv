Circular Economy (Online Learning)	University of Edinburgh	Edinburgh Futures Institute	['Full Time', 'Part Time']	Programme descriptionEngaging with a ‘circular economy’ means moving away from a wasteful, linear economic model where resources are extracted, manufactured, used, and discarded. A circular economy strives to design out waste, with products and materials kept in use for as long as possible at a high value. Beyond the need for design and system innovations, a circular economy also means investigating how to change the way we consume and use goods and services, both locally and globally.

European Politics and External Relations	University of Amsterdam	Political Science	['Full Time']	In the Master’s in European Politics and External Relations, you will analyse politics and power in Europe. The programme focuses on the challenges of Europe as a part of an increasingly interdependent, globalised and multi-polar world. You will be given the analytical, theoretical and empirical tools to develop a deeper understanding of the EU’s role as an international actor. You will also gain knowledge on both internal and external dimensions of EU policies such as for example the economic crisis, challenges surrounding security, the environment, the refugee crisis, the rise of populism, trade as well as the EU’s role in its immediate neighbourhood and the world and many more topics. Our teaching is research-led and our programme offers access to seminars and debates of the research community of ACCESS Europe. During past years, European Politics and External Relations track students were given the opportunity to attend a study trip to Brussels, which included meetings and discussions in key EU institutions.

Master of Science in Reproductive Biotechnologies	University of Teramo	Faculty of Bioscience and Technology for Food, Agriculture and Environment	['Full Time', 'Part Time']	The Course provides the fundamental theoretical and practical knowledge necessary to understand and perform novel techniques in the areas of reproductive biology and biomedical research. The ultimate aim of the Course is to train experts able to manage laboratories of medically-assisted reproduction both referring to humans and animals. Such course aims at providing detailed and up-to-date lessons, also through individual laboratory practice, on the structure and function of gametes, on the biological and molecular mechanisms that control the interactions between sperms and oocytes, the fertilization process and the embryonic development. The students will acquire the most recent techniques to isolate, manipulate, and cryoconserve both animal gametes and embryos, as well as the techniques for their biochemical, genetic, morphological and functional characterization in the field of reproductive medicine. The Course is mainly student-oriented, providing a system of tailored tutorship, with periodically-administered check-in interim tests in all course units.

MSc Urban Design & Planning	University College Dublin	UCD School of Architecture, Planning and Environmental Policy	['Full Time']	Graduate Taught (level 9 nfq, credits 90)Urban design lies at the interface of architecture and urban planning, with both disciplines contributing complementary but contrasting approaches to urban design theory and practice. The delivery of this master's programme draws on the distinct methodologies, professional perspectives and pedagogies of both urban planning and architectural disciplinary areas within the school. It provides specialist knowledge and skills in urban design theory and practice, urban conservation; nature-based solutions, and the relationship between research and design. The programme will enable graduates to work as part of a multidisciplinary team to create better places through urban design. Students will also have the opportunity to draw upon the School’s research expertise to place urban design centre stage in tackling a range of pressing environmental and other issues. The programme will appeal to graduates from closely related disciplinary backgrounds wishing to specialise in urban design, including those with qualifications in architecture, landscape architecture, and planning.

Cancer Medicine (MSc/MRes)	Queen’s University Belfast	School of Medicine, Dentistry & Biomedical Sciences	['Full Time']	The MSc(Res) in Cancer Medicine will provide students with new knowledge of how precision medicine can improve and shape future healthcare. Students will gain hands-on experience of molecular techniques and the equipment/devices used in a modern molecular laboratory; the course will provide training in laboratory and research skills that are applicable across multiple scientific disciplines in a supportive learning environment. Central to this research-intensive programme is a 24-week Research Project (which runs throughout both semesters) where students undertake hands-on research training within active research teams. Through taught modules students will be able to evaluate how novel therapeutic approaches can be used to stratify patients into treatment groups for better clinical management (a concept known as stratified / precision medicine). They will observe the delivery of precision medicine through tours of the Northern Ireland Cancer Centre.	September	Please see the university website for further information on fees for this course.

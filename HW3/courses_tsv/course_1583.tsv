Bioscience, Technology and Public Policy - MSc	The University of Winnipeg	Graduate Studies	[]	This graduate program will give students advanced training in the Life Sciences in fields ranging from Genomics and Bioinformatics to Natural Resource Management. Students will receive hands-on training in their discipline providing with skills preparing them to work in both academia and industry. Our program will take advantage of the new Science Complex that will provide UWinnipeg students with access to innovative technology and laboratories. The program will develop communication skills to facilitate interaction with managers, policy-makers and the public, and students will place the results of their science in the broader context of society at large.  This program meets growing local, national and international demands in both the health and environmental sciences. Winnipeg is the nexus for health sciences research with the development of BioMed City, growing research capacity in the biotechnology industry, and the presence of provincial and federal government health agencies. Interest in the environmental sciences is similarly growing rapidly, and our graduate program will coincide with launch of the Richardson College for the Environment at the University of Winnipeg. Our MissionThe power of science to change the face of modern society is growing at an ever increasing pace. Science and technology are tools that can and do improve the human condition in many ways. But the rapid pace of change also brings unforeseen consequences and perils. Science and technology cannot develop effectively within a social vacuum. The objective of this program is to train students not only in the advanced methods of science, but to place this body of knowledge in the broader context of modern society. In addition to conducting research in the BioSciences, our graduate students receive advanced training in both the technology and policy dimensions of science providing every student with a skill set that prepares them to work in both academia and industry at an advanced level in every area of biology. Our GoalsOur educational objectives are four-fold. First, we provide our students with an applied education in the methods of science. Second, we educate our students in the methods of scientific literacy. Third, we educate our students on the relationship between science and the community around us. This will involve the study of science and ethics, and science and the development of public policy. Fourth, we educate our students in the methods of communicating science to policy-makers and the general public. We are training students not only in the basic methods of science, but how in to make a difference in society.	See Course		MSc	See website for details.

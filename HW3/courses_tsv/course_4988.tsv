Investigating the genetic basis of sexual dimorphism in insect eye size	Durham University	Department of Biosciences	[]	Sexual dimorphism is pervasive in animals, from the shape and size of individual organs and differences in overall body size to elaborate male ornaments. Compound eyes are a key sensory organ of insects and their size is often sexually dimorphic within species reflecting differences in female and male behaviour. Compound eyes are composed of facets or ommatidia and the number and width of ommatidia determines visual acuity and contrast sensitivity. Female Drosophila melanogaster fruit flies have larger eyes composed of more ommatidia than males. In XX flies the Drosophila female sex determination pathway is activated and regulates the gene regulatory network for eye development to generate more cells and more ommatidia. In XY flies the female sex determination pathway is switched off and smaller male eyes develop. How eye development responds to the sex determination pathway is not known. The aim of this project is to characterise these mechanisms by genetically masculinizing female fly eyes and using gene expression analysis to identify genes that change expression in response. This will identify how sex determination pathways integrate with the developmental gene regulatory networks that build organs to help reveal how organ size is specified and the mechanisms underlying differences between female and male sensory organs.

Cyber Security (MSc)	University of Trento	EIT Digital Master School - University of Trento	['Full Time']	Cybersecurity has been called the greatest threat to every company in the world. As the world becomes increasingly autonomous and tech-driven, this threat will only continue to grow. And if addressing the threat itself was not enough, companies will also need to comply with an increasingly complex set of data protection rules and regulations.All of these require that companies have access to a digitally equipped pool of talent. So, this is where EIT Digital comes into play. With our Cybersecurity master's programme, you will not only build the skills to compete for the often high-paying jobs, but you will also gain the confidence to help drive the transformation toward a safer, more secure digital world.

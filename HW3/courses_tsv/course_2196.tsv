Computational Social Science	Linköping University	Graduate School	['Full Time']	Use statistical and computational methods to understand society and human behaviour. The programme prepares you to harness complex data and advanced computational tools to address these and other important social questions.The increased integration of technology into our lives has created unprecedented volumes of data on everyday human behaviour. Troves of detailed social data related to choices, affiliations, preferences and interests are now digitally archived by internet service providers, media companies, other private-sector firms, and governments. New computational approaches based on predictive modeling, agent-based simulations, text analysis, and network science make it possible to analyse these data in insightful and novel ways.

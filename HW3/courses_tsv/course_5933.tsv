Master River Delta Development	Van Hall Larenstein, University of Applied Sciences	Masters programmes	['Full Time']	Due to climate change and the growth of the world population in delta areas, we face urgent social issues. Within the master River Delta Development you will develop knowledge and competencies of delta technology, practiceoriented research and transitions, with the aim of safeguarding welfare and prosperity for future generations. You will become a facilitator of change for river deltas. In this study programme three universities of applied sciences combine their complementing expertise in the fields of coastal regions, river systems, and urban water. This will provide you with insight into how the different component systems operate, how they relate to each other, and how the delta functions as a cohesive system. By focusing on the international context, you will learn how to apply this knowledge in deltas around the world.

City Design and Social Science MSc	London School of Economics and Political Science	Department of Sociology	['Full Time', 'Part Time']	Ask LSEThe MSc City Design and Social Science focuses on the relations between the social and spatial organisation of cities and urban environments. We see design as a field of research, knowledge and practice that shapes urban environments, responds to urban problems, and integrates social, spatial and political approaches to the city. This ground-breaking programme was launched in 1998. It supports the development of interdisciplinary urban practitioners and scholars who can work across professional divides to have a positive impact on cities as both social and built environments. 	September	Please see the university website for further information on fees for this course.

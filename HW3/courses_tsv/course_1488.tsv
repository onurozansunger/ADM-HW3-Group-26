Biomedical and Analytical Science MSc	University of Huddersfield	School of Applied Sciences	['Full Time']	The Biomedical and Analytical Science MSc course will enable you to develop a postgraduate depth of knowledge relating to biomedicine and analytical methodologies utilised in biomedical science. Moreover, you will broaden and develop your ability to deal with complex issues, demonstrate originality in tackling and solving problems, function as independent learner and show initiative in complex and unpredictable professional environments, all of which represent key skills in the professional employment sector. Specifically, you will study cutting-edge research that is driving forward our understanding of the human genome and how it is expressed alongside the development of new biomedical technology platforms and how these are opening up novel ways to treat human disease. You will investigate the underlying biology, epidemiology and evolution of pathogens, how these are diagnosed and then monitored and the novel approaches being developed to treat emerging viruses and multi-drug-resistant bacteria. Biological aspects of disease processes will also be considered for major human illnesses, such as cardiovascular disease, autoimmune disorders, and cancer. Alongside this, you will be trained in the development and application of advanced analytical techniques in biomedical sciences, including recent advances in analytical technologies, including nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), mass spectroscopy (MS), X-ray crystallography and immunohistochemistry.

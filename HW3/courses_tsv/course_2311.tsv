Conflict, Security and Development MSc	University of Edinburgh	School of Social and Political Science	['Full Time', 'Part Time']	The MSc Conflict, Security, and Development programme focuses on the intersection of conflict, security and development, both conceptually and in practice. It critically explores the notion that security is a precondition for development and that development leads to security. This ‘security-development nexus’ has become a central theme in the way development programmes are designed and implemented, particularly those focused on the Global South. Yet there are many important debates and unsettled questions about the linkages between conflict, security and development. For example, what is the role of poverty in conflict? How does this framing of development affect our understanding of issues such as inequality, democracy and justice? How do everyday imaginations of security interact with high-level security politics?

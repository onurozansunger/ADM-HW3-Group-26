Data Science MSc	University of East London	School of Architecture, Computing and Engineering	['Full Time', 'Part Time', 'Online']	The MSc in Data Science is aimed at providing opportunities for students who wish to establish expertise and employment in data-centric, largely quantitative areas within a broad range of professional disciplines and areas of employment. A cross-disciplinary approach is therefore central to the delivery of the programme.According to Hal Varian, Google Chief Economist, “The ability to take data - to be able to understand it, to process it, to extract value from it, to visualize it, to communicate it - that’s going to be a hugely important skill in the next decades.” It is these skills and the knowledge that underpins them that are the focus of this programme.

Algal Biotechnology and Bioeconomy MSc	University of the Highlands and Islands	Science, Health and Engineering	['Full Time', 'Online']	Algal biotechnology is a rapidly expanding discipline that seeks to understand and harness the resources of some of the most diverse groups of organisms on the planet.Algae are comprised of microscopic photosynthetic organisms and macroscopic seaweeds, and are key to human life on earth, producing much of the oxygen that we breathe and underpinning the base of freshwater and marine food chains. Furthermore, algae and their natural products have a huge range of current and potential applications for humans: developing applications include pharmaceuticals, pigments, nutraceuticals, biofuels, enzymes, fertilisers, and bioremediation materials, on earth and even for space applications.

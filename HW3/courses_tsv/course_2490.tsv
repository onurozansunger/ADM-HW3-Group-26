Cultural and Creative Communication MSc	Aberdeen University	Language, Literature, Music and Visual Culture	['Full Time', 'Part Time']	If you are fascinated by our changing cultural life across the world and you want to experience being involved in communication the festivals and events we have on offer globally, the cultural and creative communications programme offered by Aberdeen will help you towards that goal. In Scotland alone there are many famous festivals such as the Fringe and Edinburgh Festival, the Fireballs Festival in Stonehaven near Aberdeen, Uphelia in Shetland, and the Cullen Skink contest in Cullen to name just a few. The programme is very exciting as it is multidisciplinary and you can choose a variety of different options in line with your own interest areas. This is not just a typical communications programme in the sense of simply writing press releases or articles, it offers you the chance to get involved in the build and design side of things and the actual communication of exhibitions themselves too.

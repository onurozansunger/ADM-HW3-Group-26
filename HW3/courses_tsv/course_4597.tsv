Interaction Design Masters	Malmö University	Masters Programmes	['Full Time']	Interaction design concerns the design of digital artifacts and digitally mediated communication, with a focus on use experience.Interaction design is a rapidly changing discipline, and we maintain the relevance of our education by working with real-world design cases and external clients including local industry partners and cultural and civic organisations. Navigating a shifting design landscape also requires the critical mind-set of a scholar, and we foster reflective design by teaching research skills and involving students in active research projects.

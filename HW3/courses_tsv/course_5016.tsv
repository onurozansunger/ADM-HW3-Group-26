Italian Food and Wine	University of Padua	School of Agriculture and Veterinary Medicine	['Full Time']	The Master’s degree in Italian Food and Wine explores understanding, management, promotion and protection of high-value food products. The Italian food production system serves as a model to identify the specific elements outlining the unique value of food products, which are inextricably linked to place (terroir) through historical, social and cultural ties. This background couples with the most recent developments in technology, nutrition, food safety, diet and health, and sensory science, core elements of a growing international demand for terroir-related high-value foods.

Global Energy and Climate Policy MSc	SOAS University of London	Centre for International Studies and Diplomacy	['Full Time']	The MSc Global Energy and Climate Policy degree programme addresses important issues of our time. The use of energy – electricity generation, transportation, heating/cooling and industrial consumption – is the most important driver of climate change by far. Effectively addressing this urgent global challenge therefore requires transformational changes in the ways we produce, consume and govern energy. More than two decades of political contestation have shown that a supportive policy environment – meaningful and consistent domestic laws and regulation underpinned by ambitious international treaties – is the only way to affect these changes, develop alternatives to emissions-intensive fossil fuels and transition economies around the world onto a secure, low-carbon and climate-friendly footing.
